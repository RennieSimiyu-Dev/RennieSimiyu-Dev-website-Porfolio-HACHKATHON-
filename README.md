# My Portfolio Website

This is my first personal portfolio built with HTML and CSS.

It includes:
- An "About Me" section
- My skills as a designer and developer
- A sample project
- Contact information with WhatsApp and GitHub links

The design is simple, responsive, and beginner-friendly.

Feel free to explore!
